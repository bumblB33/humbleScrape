Scrape the Planet!

This script is designed to scrape the titles of books out of your Humble Bundle library, but really, you could put any url you wanted into that variable. 
All you'd need to do was update the makeSoup.select('') entry to include the name of the element you're looking for. 
Beautiful Soup can also select by id attribute, CSS class, and any combination of the above. Have fun! <3
