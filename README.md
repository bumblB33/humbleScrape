Scrape the Planet!

This script was originally designed to scrape the titles of books out of my 
Humble Bundle library, but really, you could put any url you wanted into 
that variable. All you'd need to do was update the makeSoup.select('') 
entry to include the name of the element you're looking for. 
Beautiful Soup can also select by id attribute, CSS class, and any 
combination of the above. Reference documentation at 
https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Have fun! <3
